# Chrome Dino Game - Modified

What do you do when you get bored of a game? You rebuild it but better! 🦖

## About This Project

This is a modified version of the classic Chrome Dino game with some exciting new features:

### ✨ New Features
- **Gravity Inversion Mode**: Every 8 seconds, gravity flips!
- **Ceiling Running**: The dino clings to the "ceiling" and hurdles inverted cacti
- **Enhanced Physics**: Completely reimagined jumping mechanics, and the dino now runs on the ceiling
- **Clean Interface**: Removed unnecessary things on the screen
- **Invisible Mode**: When trying to bend, the dino will be invisible (just for fun, but hes actually physically there)
